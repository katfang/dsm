=== General notes
* The manager always needs to be run first. 
* The system can work with AT MOST 5 clients.
* The network IPs and ports are set in network.h

=== Read/Write Testing

We have the following simple test to show that multiple processes can
make progress while writing to the same page.  To run it, start three
different processes (from separate terminals) as follows:

  $ ./manager
  $ ./dsm_test 1
  $ ./dsm_test 2

The manager simply spawns the manager thread while the other two
processes actually do the work.  The program can support up to 5 such
writers.

=== Open/Malloc Testing

We wrote a small program in order to test that the simple malloc
algorithm was capable of allocating sections of memory. This is run
similarly to the above dsm_test. 

  $ ./manager
  $ ./alloc_test 1
  $ ./alloc_test 2

=== Lock Testing

This program demonstrates the ability to create a pthread_mutex_t lock that lives in shared memory. The program asks the user to lock / release the lock so that different locking situations can be simulated. 

  $ ./manager
  $ ./lock_test 1
  $ ./lock_test 2
  $ ./lock_test 3
